A Graphical user interface to implement Machine Learning Algorithms.


# USE
Select the file and the target(Expected output) should be in the last Column.
Select the implementation type.
You will get the desired result.

# Make your own
All you have to do is to build a model using a standard dataset or your own synthesized data and then put the trained model to an application with a GUI. The interface can accept inputs from the user and display the relevant outputs from the model.
